## About Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that simplifies the design and layout of responsive web pages. It provides pre-designed components like navigation bars, forms, buttons, and layouts, making web development faster and more consistent. For this project, Bootstrap was used to style the pages and ensure that they are mobile-responsive and visually appealing.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project from the Git repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate to other pages (like `login.html`, `register.html`, and `user-menu.html`) to explore the functionality and design.
